# Song Settings

A small mod to tweak Audica's input offset and target speed per song.  

A song's target speed will multiply your original target speed.  
The same goes for offset but it gets added onto your original offset instead.  

Example:  
150% Target speed * 150% Song Target speed = 225%  
15ms input offset + 5ms song offset = 20ms
